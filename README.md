# Dementia-Detection-Based-on-Speech-Transcript-Analysis
The project titled "Dementia Detection Based on Speech Transcript Analysis" aims to identify early signs of dementia by analyzing linguistic and grammatical patterns in speech transcripts. The approach involves extracting key features such as grammatical structures, lexical diversity, and hesitation markers from spoken language. These features are then used to train supervised machine learning models for accurate classification between healthy and potentially dementia-affected speech. The system is implemented using Python in environments like Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab, and employs libraries such as TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Pandas, and NumPy for feature extraction, model training, and performance visualization. This research contributes to non-invasive, language-based diagnostic support tools for early dementia detection.
